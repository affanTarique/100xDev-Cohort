How to Run Tests
Your working directory must be /assignments/week-2/01-async-js
Do npm install
To run tests run npx jest ./tests/<filename-of-test> for example, npx jest ./tests/1-promisify-setTimeout.test.js
If the above does not work for you, to run tests run npm run <name-of-test> for example, npm run 1-promisify-setTimeout
To run all tests run npx jest ./tests/ or npm run all
